This folder highlights three chosen case studies (one per hazard) and the plots and information can can be determined from them. It is important to note that these are chosen case studies, but this package aims to be usable across many, not just the ones shown here. 

These notebooks also highlight a few of the decisions made in this package, including the integration of relative elevation to the nearest river location due to the elevational changes of the river Tweed in my testing.
